## 👋 Hi, I'm Nhat Nguyen

I am a **Technical Project Manager** and **Tech Lead** based in Hanoi, Vietnam. At 20, I find myself at the fascinating intersection of engineering logic and product leadership.

Currently, I am the **Co-founder and Tech Lead** of **PMLogin**, a desktop automation tool designed to bridge the gap between complex browser automation and user-friendly experience.

### 🛠 What I Do
* **Engineering Leadership**: I lead a talented team of nearly 10 developers and interns, focusing on building a high-performance culture and shipping quality code.
* **Technical Management**: I manage project lifecycles, translating business requirements into technical roadmaps using tools like **Linear** and **Notion**.
* **Full-stack Development**: My core expertise lies in **Python (PyQt)** and **PHP (Laravel)**, with a deep interest in system architecture and cybersecurity.

### 🛡 Tech Interests
I have a strong passion for:
* **Cybersecurity**: Specifically proxies, anti-detect browsers, and threat intelligence.
* **Automation**: Streamlining workflows and building efficient desktop/web solutions.
* **Minimalism**: Applying minimalist principles to both code and life.

### 💻 My Workspace
I believe that a focused mind starts with a focused environment. My current setup includes:
* **MacBook Air M4** for portability and performance.
* **34-inch Ultrawide Monitor** for maximum screen real estate.
* **Xinmeng X98 Pro v2** mechanical keyboard for a tactile writing experience.
